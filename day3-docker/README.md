# Project Overview

In this project, you'll go through all three lifecycles of Docker: pulling an image and creating a container, modifying the container and creating a new image, and finally, creating a Dockerfile to build and deploy a web application.

# Part 1: Creating a Container from a Pulled Image:
Objective: Pull the official Nginx image from Docker Hub and run it as a container.
Steps: 

1. Pull the Nginx Image:
docker pull nginx
    • pull the latest Nginx image from Docker Hub.
    • This command will download the latest Nginx image from the Docker Hub repository to your local machine.
