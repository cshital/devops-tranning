# SysOps System Monitoring and Reporting Script


## Overview

This comprehensive shell script is designed for system operations (sysops) to automate system monitoring and generate detailed reports. The script leverages advanced Linux shell scripting techniques to monitor system metrics, capture logs, and provide actionable insights for system administrators.
Features

Script Initialization:
    Initializes script with necessary variables and configurations.
    Validates required commands and utilities availability.

System Metrics Collection:
    Monitors CPU usage, memory utilization, disk space, and network statistics.
    Captures process information including top processes consuming resources.

Log Analysis:
    Parses system logs (e.g., syslog) for critical events and errors.
    Generates summaries of recent log entries based on severity.

Health Checks:
    Checks the status of essential services (e.g., Apache, MySQL).
    Verifies connectivity to external services or databases.

Alerting Mechanism:
    Implements thresholds for critical metrics (CPU, memory) triggering alerts.
    Sends email notifications to sysadmins with critical alerts.

Report Generation:
    Compiles all collected data into a detailed report.
    Includes graphs or visual representations where applicable.

Automation and Scheduling:
    Configures the script to run periodically via cron for automated monitoring.
    Ensures the script can handle both interactive and non-interactive execution modes.

User Interaction:
    Provides options for interactive mode to allow sysadmins to manually trigger checks or view specific metrics.
    Ensures the script is user-friendly with clear prompts and outputs.

Documentation:
    Detailed README file outlining script usage, prerequisites, and customization options.
    Examples of typical outputs and how to interpret them.

## Optional Enhancements

Database Integration:
    Stores collected metrics in a database for historical analysis.

Web Interface:
    Develops a basic web interface using shell scripting (with CGI) for remote monitoring and reporting.

Customization:
    Allows customization of thresholds and monitoring parameters via configuration files.

Prerequisites

Ensure the following commands and utilities are available:
    `awk`, `grep`, `sed`, `df`, `top`, `netstat`, `mail`, `systemctl`, `curl`

Usage
Running the Script

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
./monitoring_script.sh
```

Script Initialization

    Initialize necessary variables and configurations.
    Validate the availability of required commands.

System Metrics Collection

Monitor CPU usage:

```
top -b -n1 | grep "Cpu(s)"
```

Monitor memory utilization:

```
free -m
```

Monitor disk space:

```
df -h
```

Monitor network statistics:

```
netstat -i
```

Capture top processes:

```
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -n 10
```

Log Analysis

Parse system logs for critical events:

```
grep -i "error" /var/log/syslog
```

Generate summaries of recent log entries:

```
tail -n 100 /var/log/syslog | awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $5, $6, $7}'
```

Health Checks

Check the status of essential services:

```
systemctl status apache2
systemctl status mysql
```

Verify connectivity to external services:

```
curl -sSf http://example.com > /dev/null
```

Alerting Mechanism

Implement thresholds for critical metrics and send email alerts:

```
CPU_USAGE=$(top -b -n1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2 + $4}')
if [ $(echo "$CPU_USAGE > 80" | bc) -eq 1 ]; then
    echo "High CPU usage: $CPU_USAGE%" | mail -s "CPU Alert" admin@example.com
fi
```

Report Generation

    Compile data into a detailed report:

```bash
echo "System Report" > report.txt
echo "CPU Usage:" >> report.txt
top -b -n1 | grep "Cpu(s)" >> report.txt
echo "Memory Usage:" >> report.txt
free -m >> report.txt
echo "Disk Space:" >> report.txt
df -h >> report.txt
```

## Automation and Scheduling

Schedule the script to run periodically via cron:

```
crontab -e
```

Add the following line to run the script every hour:


```
0 * * * * /path/to/monitoring_script.sh
```

User Interaction
Interactive mode to manually trigger checks:

```
./monitoring_script.sh -i
```

Documentation
Detailed documentation provided in this README file.

Customization
    Customize thresholds and monitoring parameters via configuration files:

```
vim config.cfg
```

Examples
Typical Output

Example of a CPU usage alert:

## Subject: CPU Alert

High CPU usage: 85%
Example of a system report:

```bash
System Report
CPU Usage:
%Cpu(s):  2.7 us,  0.3 sy,  0.0 ni, 96.7 id,  0.2 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.1 si,  0.0 st
Memory Usage:
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           7940        1503        5023         169        1412        5905
Disk Space:
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1        50G   19G   30G  39% /
